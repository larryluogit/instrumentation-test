# Standalone library instrumentation

This repository also publishes standalone instrumentation for several libraries (and growing)
that can be used if you prefer that over using the Java agent:

* [Apache Dubbo](../instrumentation/apache-dubbo-2.7/library-autoconfigure)
* [Armeria](../instrumentation/armeria-1.3/library)
* [AWS Lambda](../instrumentation/aws-lambda/aws-lambda-core-1.0/library)

And some libraries are publishing their own OpenTelemetry instrumentation (yay!), e.g.

* [http4k](https://www.http4k.org/guide/reference/opentelemetry/)

If you know of additional libraries that are publishing their own OpenTelemetry instrumentation, please let us know!
