# Overhead tests

This is a work in progress. 

This directory will contain tools and utilities
that help us to measure the performance overhead introduced by 
the agent and to measure how this overhead changes over time.

## Setup and Usage

Once we have an established base image published for `spring-petclinic-rest`, this step
can be avoided by most users. For now, there is just a spring petclinic base image.

```
$ docker build -f Dockerfile-petclinic-base .
```

Remaining usage TBD.
