## Contributing

Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome, but before submitting new features
or changes to current functionality [open an
issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/new)
and discuss your ideas or propose the changes you wish to make. After a
resolution is reached a PR can be submitted for review.

In order to build and test this whole repository you need JDK 11+.
Some instrumentations and tests may put constraints on which java versions they support.
See [Running the tests](./docs/contributing/running-tests.md) for more details.

### Building

#### Snapshot builds

For developers testing code changes before a release is complete, there are
snapshot builds of the `master` branch. They are available from
[JFrog OSS repository](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/io/opentelemetry/instrumentation/)

#### Building from source

Build using Java 11:

```bash
java -version
```

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

and then generate the -all artifact

```bash
./gradlew :javaagent:shadowJar
```

and then you can find the java agent artifact at

`javaagent/build/lib/opentelemetry-javaagent-<version>-all.jar`.
