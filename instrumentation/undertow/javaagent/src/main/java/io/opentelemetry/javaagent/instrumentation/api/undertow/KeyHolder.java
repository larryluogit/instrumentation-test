/**
 * Undertow's {@link HttpServerExchange} uses {@link AttachmentKey} as a key for storing arbitrary
 * data. It uses {@link IdentityHashMap} and thus all keys are compared for equality by object
 * reference. This means that we cannot hold an instance of {@link AttachmentKey} in a static field
 * of the corresponding Tracer, as we usually do. Tracers are loaded into user's classloaders and
 * thus it is totally possible to have several instances of tracers. Each of those instances will
 * have a separate value in a static field and {@link HttpServerExchange} will treat them as
 * different keys then.
 *
 * <p>That is why this class exists and resides in a separate package. This package is treated in a
 * special way and is always loaded by bootstrap classloader. This makes sure that this class is
 * available to all tracers from every classloader.
 *
 * <p>But at the same time, being loaded by bootstrap classloader, this class itself cannot initiate
 * the loading of {@link AttachmentKey} class. Class has to be loaded by <i>any</i> classloader that
 * has it, e.g. by the classloader of a Tracer that uses this key holder. After that, <i>all</i>
 * Tracers, loaded by all classloaders, will be able to use exactly the same sole instance of the
 * key.
