 * classes (e.g. {@code org.gradle.*}) and classloaders. This is mainly done to improve startup
 * time, but also to explicitly disable instrumentation of a specific types (e.g. other agents). An
 * implementation of this class can be used to override this behaviour.
 *
 * <p>This is a service provider interface that requires implementations to be registered in {@code
