This document describes any changes that have been made to the
settings for this repository beyond the [OpenTelemetry default repository
settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/docs/how-to-configure-new-repository.md#repository-settings).

## General > Pull Requests

* Allow squash merging > Default to pull request title and description

* Allow auto-merge

## Collaborators and teams

* [@opentelemetrybot](https://github.com/opentelemetrybot) has write permission in order to
  enable [comment-driven PR automation](workflows/comment-driven-pr-automation.yml).

## Actions > General

* Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators:
  "Require approval for first-time contributors who are new to GitHub"

  (To reduce friction for new contributors,
  as the default is "Require approval for first-time contributors")

## Branch protections

### `main`

* Require branches to be up to date before merging: UNCHECKED

  (PR jobs take too long, and leaving this unchecked has not been a significant problem)

* Status checks that are required:

  * EasyCLA
  * required-status-check

### `release/*`

Same settings as above for [`main`](#main).

### `opentelemetrybot/**/**`

Same settings as for [`dependabot/**/**`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/docs/how-to-configure-new-repository.md#branch-protection-rule-dependabot)

### `gh-pages`

* Everything UNCHECKED

  (This branch is currently only used for directly pushing benchmarking results from the
  [Nightly overhead benchmark](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/actions/workflows/nightly-benchmark-overhead.yml)
  job)
